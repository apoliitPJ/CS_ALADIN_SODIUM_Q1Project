        <div class="body" style="color: black;">Suicide is a deeply troubling and complex issue that affects individuals, families, communities, and societies at large. It is a global public health concern with far-reaching implications for mental health, social well-being, and public policy. To address this grave challenge effectively, it is essential to employ statistical analysis and data-driven insights to understand its prevalence, patterns, and associated factors. 
            <br>
            <br>
            This statistics report aims to identify who among the genders are much more prone to suicide. Since the rate of suicide is increasing rapidly we must find a way to stop this, and so our solution is to find a group of people to prioritize helping first, and that is why we are trying to find out which gender has the highest suicide rate and on what most of them continent do they belong to.
